# vcf2phylip
The script is a fork modified from the 
[original v2.1](https://github.com/edgardomortiz/vcf2phylip). 
The script was modified so as to deal with the situation, where ploidy of 
genotypes is different by individuals (sex) (e.g., X-chromosomes). 

The script was tested with the VCF files produced by Stacks 2.5 and those 
modified by [diploid2haploid.py](https://github.com/itots/diploid2haploid).

Usage is same with the original.
